-Made a U-Net image segmentation model for the U-Net-based image segmentation model tailored for the Kaggle
Cityscapes Image Pairs dataset. This model excels in semantic segmentation, accurately delineating various ele-
ments within traffic images. Can be used in diverse computer vision applications, including traffic flow analysis,
object recognition, and scene understanding.


â€“ Implemented using Python and its libraries like Tensorflow, MatPlotLib, CV2 and NumPy
